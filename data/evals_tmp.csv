I didn't learn a lot from this class. Lectures were extremely boring, although it was clear that the instructor was trying to make it exciting with all the jokes and examples that might resonate with the ""undergraduate"" population. However, I thought most
Easy intro to linguistics.
This class was very interesting to me. I think the homework was awesome as a preparation for the tests and helped to integrate what we learned in class.
Good course, but since Iâ€™m not a linguistics person, I found it hard to be engaged in the material sometimes. Even so, the course is well designed and organized that I recommend this course to people looking for a good D2 or just interested in linguistics
Good distribution course. Some concepts were confusing, but Dr. Taylor did a good job to explain them to us.
This class was a good overview of the study of linguistics. I took it because of the Cog Sci major requirements, but actually found the material quite interesting. 1 midterm, final, 8 assignments (1 of which is dropped). I thought that the assignments hel
The course feels overly rushed. Entire linguistics principles (phonetics, morphology, syntax,etc.) were done in a week.
This course isn't organized very well, making it hard to figure out what is important to pay attention to. Two take home tests and homework that is worth 60% of the grade. It wasn't enjoyable, but an A is definitely possible.
The class provides a good introduction to a variety of topics in linguistics. The homeworks were most useful in learning the material for the midterm and final.
This was a difficult class for distribution, but Professor Taylor was really interesting and engaging.
This class was extremely interesting! The course itself was not very rigorous, but I still learned a lot. There were homework assignments every week or two, one take home midterm, and one take home final. The exams were mostly multiple choice. I enjoyed a
Easy course if you do the work and the readings
This was a pretty interesting course that offered some insight into other studies (since my major is in the natural sciences). It's also not too difficult to get a good grade, so I think it's an excellent choice for distribution.
The class provided a very broad overview of various linguistic forms and processes. It was very interesting. There was very little work for the class- 8 homeworks, one midterm, one final, and some (optional) readings.
I thought it was an interesting class with interesting material
Easy class...good for distribution credit.
The course was a lot of fun. The material was pretty interesting, and Dr. Taylor is a very enjoyable and funny lecturer. The class was very laid back. We had homework almost every week, but it was generally just a worksheet. Overall, the class was enjoyab
This was a great distribution course to take. Not too challenging but still interesting.

The class is a good D2, relies a lot on homework, but it's not too hard/time consuming. if you do the work, you're likely to get a good grade.
If you are going to take this course, take it with Chris Taylor! He is super easygoing and will rap for your class.
This is everything you want in a class (if you take it with Taylor). Very interesting material, homework doesn't take long but still teaches you something, very good lecturer, and not hard to get a decent grade. And you get distribution credit. Take it.
Easy class to pass/fail
This course was poorly run by the professor.
This was a really good class with an amazing professor who was very understanding of people taking for distribution.
Much easier compared to other professors. Laid-back presentation of material. You get what you put in.
This was a pretty straightforward class in terms of workload and test preparation. It was pretty interesting at times and served as a good introductory course to linguistics.
Interesting class! I enjoyed all the topics that we covered. It was a good overview course and a great intro.
Do not take this course if you are looking for an easy D2. The TA's graded the homework too harshly and made the class a lot harder than it was supposed to be. The class consisted of only homework, a midterm, a and final, but I did not enjoy the class. Th
The class itself was really fun and interesting, and I learned alot about linguistics that I never even thought existed. Overall, this class was a good comprehensive review of linguistics and all its facets.

Dr. Englebretsen makes this course feel like a big puzzle game. The assignments are actually kinda fun (yes, I know that sounds crazy)and definitely make the information very easy to understand. The only negative is that the TAs grade hard sometime.
This was an excellent course to take for distribution credit and I thoroughly enjoyed the topics and material presented
I found out mid-way through the year that I do not have an ear for linguistics. I can't distinguish between the vowel pronunciations, so I was lost a little bit throughout the entire class. My TA was a little unnerving but if I needed assistance I could
This course is both extremely interesting and engaging. With all the resources available to help you master the material, a low grade is most likely due to lack of effort on the student's part. I enjoyed the challenge immensely, and I have several classm
Really interesting class to take even if you have never thought about linguistics before. I originally took it for distribution, but will now probably be a ling major.
Overall an easy D2 credit to take. Workload was very easy to manage and the assignments perfectly prepared the students for the midterm and final.
Kind of a tough class if you're not really interested in it. Usually weekly homework assignments that take about 3 hours to finish. A lot about grammar instead of culture stuff, which was boring for me.
The course was extremely well organized. Dr. Englebretson gave us handouts to print out before class (or he would supply hard copies in class)that were very helpful to take notes on and for following along with the slides. I thought the material was extre

This class is a good overview of a lot of different linguistic topics. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting distribution credit or a taste of linguistics.
Took it for distribution. Not as easy as I thought it would be
This was a typical intro level class. Pretty easy to get bored unless you are actually genuinely interested in linguistics.
I came into this class with the attitude of ""this is just a class I have to take"" and came out of it with a genuine interest in linguistics. The class was very lecture-oriented, which I liked (probably wouldn't have even had to buy the book). Fascinatin
The coursework (homework assignments) were tough at times, and graded rather strictly. There aren't many corners in this class I could cut, so I'd recommend putting a lot of time into this class if you want an A.
Average introductory course that doesn't really stick out in my Rice experience. Wasn't stimulated by the material or its presentation.
It's interesting, if a little heavy on the phonetics more than I expected.
If you're at all interested in language or linguistics, I would definitely recommend this course. A lot of the material is pretty easy and intuitive, but be careful on the homeworks!
fun class
This class was way harder than I expected it to be. It definitely isn't an easy A (depends on the professor you get), so expect to either do all the readings or come to class. He'll also ask questions on the final about what is said in class but isn't in
Interesting class, very different from what I expected, and fun.
This course had a ton of work for being an intro level class. The grading was really harsh so I decided to take it pass/fail. There was only one midterm and one final and they were pretty manageable if you studied and had gone to class.
I really enjoyed Ling 200. Some of the lectures were a bit dry every now and then, but Dr. Englebretson kept things interesting with his humor. There's basically a homework assignment due every week or so- they take probably around 2-3 hours for each one.
Covered all aspects of linguistics somewhat superficially. Interesting if you like linguistics, otherwise the material can be pretty dull. The work load is absolutely doable. 9 homeworks (one is dropped), one midterm, and a final.
Pretty fun and interesting D2 credit--grade is based on weekly homework (which doesn't take too much time) and two online exams.
LING was a great class, really interesting and a broad, manageable overview of the field
Fantastic D2 course! The material is interesting and the workload is not bad at all: 2 exams, easy weekly homework, and an optional essay for 5% extra credit.
This is a good D2 class for someone who is looking for something that is not too challenging but a class in which one can learn something from.
The class was a good introduction to Linguistics, which can be good or bad for some people. I personally thought the material got kind of dry, but that may not be the case for everyone. Definitely take this class if you're interested in learning some cool

I think this course is a great introduction to linguistics. I didn't personally find the subject material to be terribly interesting, but I don't think that was any fault of the course format or the instructor.

Really interesting course; some topics were harder than others, but Dr. Nelson is willing to meet and work with you on them. Definitely do the extra credit because it helps in the end
I made the poor decision not to attend this class, and my responses should not be credited.
Homework contributed nicely to the course material. It helped me extend my capabilities and helped me learn the material. Some classes were boring and others were interesting, it depended on what we were learning. Three tests: Overall, were not that bad.
I've signed up for this class 5 times and always dropped it. This time, it was fun and interesting.
LING 200 is an excellent class. Before taking it, I didn't really have any idea of what the study of linguistics entailed, or how it was applicable to the real world, but this class is a great intro to a really interesting, important field of study.
The class was quite interesting and I actually really enjoyed it, even taking it it for distribution with no plans to take any more linguistics courses.
An extremely good distribution course to take. Linguistics was both interesting and engaging. The lectures also greatly contributed to the learning experience. Definitely not one of those academ classes where you just spend time doing readings.
The was an extremely interesting course, I loved the material, and the teacher was extremely kind and understanding.
Great class: informative, interesting for the most part, and a relatively easy DII.
The class is straightforward. Attend lectures or read through them on your own time. Easy stuff if you actually take the time to learn it. It's also very applicable if you plan on learning or improving any foreign languages.
I really liked Ling 200. The class covers a general outline of many linguistics topics, all in one semester. The topics were well-organized on power points, there were 11 homework assignments (some were a little too long/unhelpful), 3 exams (no final!) an

I would have appreciated a more organized approach to the subject, and a more linear examination - it seemed like the reading we did was sort of scattered and while I learned a decent amount, I couldn't really discern the direction of the course.
Not the best class. The two professors never seemed to be very organized and there never seemed to be an overarching theme to the lectures. But the workload isn't too bad.
Interesting class covering different aspects of modern asia. The class had two professors (for us, one was an anthropologist and the other was an economist) so they switch off lectures. They each sort of taught their own thing, so we ended up with a lot

This class was very interesting and greatly expanded my understanding on Asian American communities and its many aspects and components. The readings were very beneficial and the class discussions were engaging and insightful.
This course is really neat because it analyzes certain themes within diasporic communities in America and hyphenated identities. The course has 2 exams, 2 papers, a project, and a presentation.
The class was very informative and covered all aspects of Asian American life and identity. It discusses not only social pressures, historical impacts, and self perceptions -- we also delved into how those existed in the first place.
