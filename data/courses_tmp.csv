We study formal languages and methods for assessing correctness of arguments, including a brief look at modal and many-valued logics.

A previous logic course is helpful, though the course is self-contained.

ETHICS
This course deals with fundamental questions of value and morality-questions such as: What sort of life is best? What kind of person is it best to be? What does morality require of us? It also deals with important second-order questions about these fundamental questions- for example: Can morality be justified? How can we know what's right or good? Is there moral truth? What is the relation between morality and self-interest? Readings are drawn from both classical and contemporary sources.

PHILOSOPHY OF PERCEPTION
Recommended Prerequisite(s): PHIL 103 and PHIL 202.
Perception is our most immediate form of acquaintance with the world. It is a rich source of experience and of information. Perception guides action and it grounds concepts and beliefs. Yet, the world we encounter perceptually can seem to differ dramatically from the world as described by science. This course aims at an understanding of the nature of perception and of perceptual experience.
