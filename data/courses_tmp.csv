Students will read a selection of contemporary ethnographies deemed ""exemplary"" by diverse audiences paired with theoretical works that the authors claim in their arguments. The course will focus on how ethnographies are structured, the central issues they investigate, and how they go about doing this. The central task of the class is to analyze, critically but also productively, what rigor and creativity mean in the ethnographic investigation of contemporary and recurring questions and problems, relations between questions, theory and ethnography will also be explored through students' own ethnographic writing.

TECHNOLOGY II - THE SHELL
Recommended Prerequisite: Prior completion of Technology I.
This course is the second of three required courses in the Architectural Technology sequence in the Rice of Architecture. The topics covered are the design of concrete structures and design of specialized structures including tilt wall, long span, and high-rise. Each structural type is explored in terms of the performance of the overall system, design of individual components, and relation of structure to other building subsystems such as foundation, roofing, enclosure, and interior. This course also addresses sustainability issues specific to structural systems including embodied energy, life cycle costs, and material re-use.

Emphasis will be on the development of free-hand drawing skills that will enhance the ability the ability of the design in communicating conceptual ideas. The course will consist of a combination of lectures/demonstrations, in-class drawing exercises, and out-of-class assignments. Two sketch books (one at mid-term and one at the end of the semester) will also be required. Attendance is critical.

Recommended Prerequisite(s): ARTS 365 or ARTV 365.
This class will consider different approaches to site-specific art from the 1970s to the present day through a series of 'case studies.' Artists we will look at include Robert Smithson, Ana Mendieta, Mierle Laderman Uketes, James Turrell, Mel Ziegler and Kate Ericson, Gordon Matta-Clark and Francis Alys. Students will develop projects that consider natural landscape, architecture, urban and public spaces, institutional framework, history and other contextual issues. Readings, group discussions, field trips and class critiques are integral to the course. Space in studio classes is limited. Registration does not guarantee a place in class.

DESIGNING THE SOCIAL: ARCHITECTURE & COLLECTIVE ASSOC. - 'COMRADES,' 'THE DUDE,' AND BEYOND
Although one can point to the New England town hall in Alexis de Tocqueville's ""Democracy in America"" (1835/40) or the bowling alley in connection with Robert D. Putnam's ""Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community"" (2000), architecture's social agency has been notoriously and productively difficult to pin down and architecture's relationship to the social sciences has been as tense as it has been constant. The course will focus its efforts on architecture's past and potential contribution to what has historically been called 'civic association' - the realm of social activity outside the market and purview of the state. Each class will focus on a particular architectural mode of social projection through the close reading of a single architectural work. In the major assignment for the course, students will be asked to conceive alternate architectural modes of social engagement and to speculate on their potential implications. Space is limited and registration does not guarantee a space in this course. The final course roster is formulated on the first day class by the individual instructor.

INNOVATION IN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
Process innovation in the design and construction industries is far too rare. Even with access to powerful tools such as CADD and the Internet, many opportunities for process improvement are overlooked and problems are repeatedly ignored. Within this course, cross-discipline project teams will use contemporary business tools to evaluate longstanding industry practices and develop ideas for process innovation. At the end of the semester, students will present innovation concepts to members of the Project Delivery Innovation Forum, a group of industry leaders that may select student ideas for further research on real projects.

WHOLE WORLDS
The seminar aims to conceptualize and project on the idea of architectural world-making, i.e. constructing alternative worlds through architecture. During the last two decades, architectural world-making has mostly been speculated as a social (participation) or a systemic (infrastructure) phenomenon, judged on the basis of its inclusiveness and performance within larger contingencies. On the other hand, the question of disciplinary specificity has by and large been limited to self-referential attributes of exclusive singularity. As part of outlining new directions in relation to these questions, the seminar will speculate and project on an alternative framework of architectural world-making, which both aims multiplicity and singularity while projecting unconventional associations between the two. Through focusing on a particular lineage of architectural ideas, projects and texts, the seminar aims to instigate further interplay between critical thinking and speculative work for future architectures. Space is limited and registration does not guarantee a space in this course. The final course roster is formulated on the first day class by the individual instructor.

TECHNOLOGY II - THE SHELL
Recommended Prerequiste: Prior completion of Technology I.
This course is the second of three required courses in the Architectural Technology sequence in the Rice of Architecture. The topics covered are the design of concrete structures and design of specialized structures including tilt wall, long span, and high-rise. Each structural type is explored in terms of the performance of the overall system, design of individual components, and relation of structure to other building subsystems such as foundation, roofing, enclosure, and interior. This course also addresses sustainability issues specific to structural systems including embodied energy, life cycle costs, and material re-use.

POST-1945 JAPANESE ART & ARCHITECTURE
This course investigates post-1945 Japanese art and architecture, contextualized as part of the nation's modern history, and with a particular focus on the socially and politically turbulent decades of the 1950s and 60s. Using artistic collectivism as a methodology, the course examines a wide range of collaborations in visual art and architecture, as seen in exhibitions, performances, and publications. For each lecture, Graduate Students will be assigned additional readings. They will write an annotated bibliography of all these readings to be turned in at the end of the semester. We will meet for an additional every two or three weeks to discuss interpretive and methodological problems and ideas associated with the readings. Graduate Students will be expected to complete all the requirements of the class in addition to writing a substantial research paper due at the end of the semester.

INNOVATION IN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
Process innovation in the design and construction industries is far too rare. Even with access to powerful tools such as CADD and the Internet, many opportunities for process improvement are overlooked and problems are repeatedly ignored. Within this course, cross-discipline project teams will use contemporary business tools to evaluate long- standing industry practices and develop ideas for process innovation. At the end of the semester, students will present innovation concepts to members of the Project Delivery Innovation Forum, a group of industry leaders that may select student ideas for further research on real projects. Space is limited and registration does not guarantee a space in this course. The final course roster is formulated on the first day class by the individual instructor.
